1. **Programming Langauge**: It is a set of instructions written in any specific language

2. **Machine Language**: It is a type of low level programming languages. It is a series of 0's and 1's and needs no translation.

3. **Assembly Language**: It is also a type of low level programming language that is designed for specific processors.
   It represents the set of instructions in symbolic and human understandable form. It uses an assembler to convert the assembly language to machine language.

4. **High Level Language**: It is a developer friendly language. This programming language requires a compiler or interpreter to translate the program into machine language.

5. **Procedural Programming Language**: List of instructions to tell the computer, what to do step by step. It divides a program into small procedures called routines or functions. It is also called structured programming. Examples: FORTRAN and C

6. **Functional Programmimg Language**: It is an approach to problem solving. It treats every computation as a mathematical function. It allows you to write a mathematical function i.e. a function that takes n arguments and returns a value. If the program is well executed, this function is logically evaluated as needed.

7. **Object Oriented Programming Language**: Object Oriented Programming Language is based on objects. In this language, programs are divided into small parts called objects. It uses an object oriented programming technique that binds related data and functions into an object and encourages reuse of these objects within the same and other programs. Example is JAVA

8. **Scripting Language**: scripting language is a programming language that employs high level construct to interpret and execute one command at a time. In general, scripting languages are easier to learn and faster to code in than more structured and compiled languages such as C and C++.

9. **Statically Typed Language**: Performs type checking at the time of compilation. Declaration of datatype is compulsion.

10. **Dynamically Typed Language**: Performs type checking at run time. No need to declare data types.

11. **Memory Management**: In Java, memory management is the process of allocation and de-allocation of objects called memory management. Java does memory management automatically. Java uses an automatic memory management system called a garbage collector.

12. Variables are stored in stack memory. Objects are stored in heaps.

13. **Flowchart**: A diagram that represents a workflow or process. It is nothing but a diagrammatic representation of an algorithm, a step by step approach to solving a task.

14. Components of a flowchart: It shows the steps as boxes of various kinds and their order by connecting the boxes with arrows. Important symbols are"

- Oval: It marks the start/end of the flow
- Arrow: Connector which shows the flow of relationship between various symbols
- Parallelogram: It represents input and output
- Rectangle: It represents a process
- Diamond: It is used in decision formation

15. **Process**: A process is the instance of a computer program that is being executed

16. **Algorithm**: It is a procedure or set of rules that defines how a program is to be executed. In the algorithm, plain text is used. The algorithm does not follow any rules.

17. **Pseudocode**: It is the mimic of a code. Represents code-like structure of a algorithm.
